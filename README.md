This is a web application for unicorn ride-sharing service called Wild Rydes. 
This app uses IAM, Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB, with code stored in Github and incorporated into a CI/CD pipeline with Amplify.
The app will let you create an account and log in, then request a ride by clicking on the map (powered by ArcGIS).
